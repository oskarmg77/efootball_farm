# Suggested Follow-up Tasks

## 1. Fix typo in navigation helper comment
- **Issue:** The step annotation in `agent/navigation.py` jumps directly to step 2 (`# 2. Llama a execute_action...`) without a preceding step 1, which is a typographical error in the inline documentation and confuses the intended sequence description. 【F:agent/navigation.py†L8-L21】
- **Task:** Renumber the inline comment (or add the missing introductory step) so the procedural guidance is consistent.

## 2. Resolve action-mapping runtime failure
- **Issue:** Both `agent/navigation.py` and `gui/input_test_window.py` import symbolic constants such as `ACTION_DOWN` that are not defined in `config/controls.py`, and they call `execute_action` without passing the required control scheme argument. This causes import errors and `TypeError` exceptions as soon as these modules execute. 【F:agent/navigation.py†L3-L21】【F:gui/input_test_window.py†L4-L59】【F:config/controls.py†L11-L73】【F:core/input_controller.py†L43-L103】
- **Task:** Define the missing action constants (or adjust the imports) and ensure every call to `execute_action` provides the active control mapping so the navigation helpers and GUI buttons work correctly.

## 3. Align README usage instructions with the GUI
- **Issue:** The README indicates that the main window exposes a "Probar Controles" button, but the current GUI only offers "Abrir Simulador de Controles". 【F:README.md†L102-L111】【F:gui/main_window.py†L21-L33】
- **Task:** Update the README (or the GUI text) so that the documentation reflects the actual entry point available in the interface.

## 4. Strengthen automated coverage for `execute_action`
- **Issue:** `execute_action` handles several branches (keyboard success, missing action, uninitialized gamepad, trigger logic, etc.), yet there are no automated tests validating these behaviors. 【F:core/input_controller.py†L43-L103】
- **Task:** Introduce unit tests that stub the input libraries and assert the returned status strings for both keyboard and gamepad paths, including error handling when actions are undefined or when the gamepad is unavailable.
